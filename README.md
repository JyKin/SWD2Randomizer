# SWD2Randomizer
Randomizer for the game SteamWorld Dig 2

## What does the Randomizer do?
It randomizes all upgrades on upgrade podiums (excluding the run boots) together with the three secret blueprints (Blood Quest, Thrillseeker's Tale and Deathplosions) and the triple grenade launcher. It also ensures that the resulting layout is possible to finish.

There are two possible difficulties: `Casual` and `Speedrunner`. In `Speedrunner` difficulty, you may need to:

- Use double jumps and hook jumps
- Use grenade jumps
- Dig with Deathplosions or updated Pressure Bomb

## Using the Randomizer
- Go to the [releases](https://github.com/clementgallet/SWD2Randomizer/releases) section in this repository.
- Download the latest version
- Run the program with the game shutdown
- Fill the path to the base game directory
- In the settings, choose a difficulty or input a custom seed
- Press `Randomize`. Now you can start the game, and close the randomizer if you want
- You can press `Restore` to recover the original game files. It is needed to use the randomizer again
